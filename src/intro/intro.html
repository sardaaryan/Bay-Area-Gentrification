    <h1>The Bay Area Gentrification Crisis</h1>
    <p>How the San Francisco Bay Area became the most expensive region in the United States</p>
  </div>
</header>

<article>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>

  <p>
    The San Francisco Bay Area is a vibrant region of our great country, and one of the most economically fertile
    metropolitan areas in the entire world. It is also the source of arguably the worst gentrification and housing
    shortage in the United States of America, outstripping even places such as Manhattan and Los Angeles, in
    housing costs and socioeconomic disparity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gentrification is complex, and while there is no scholarly consensus on it’s exact definition, it is generally
    understood as the process of wealthier individuals moving into lower-income neighborhoods, causing
    displacement of local residents, increased property value, costlier rents, and a shift in community culture.
    Indelibly, this leads to a housing shortage, as the cost of buying a home becomes too unaffordable for median
    income buyers. In the case of the Bay Area, this shortage is vast. The presence of these phenomena in the
    bay have a shared cause: Silicon Valley.

    <figcaption>Many of the world's Fortune 500s are right here in the bay, which means a plethora of high-income jobs.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Technological innovation around the world, and the computer science industry at large, can be traced
    back to Silicon Valley in the Bay Area. Indeed, it is still the greatest tech hub in the world. Although this
    is a source of great pride, it is also the predominant cause of gentrification in the Bay Area, as highly paid
    engineers oust the local residents from the market. As such, as of 2025, it is the most expensive place to live
    in the United States.

            While not touched on in the visualization, gentrification leads to housing crisis, which exacerbates 
            the homelessness epidemic in California at-large. Large tent encampments, like the one pictured here, are
            a common sight throughout the Bay Area.

  <p>
    This is a significant problem that has its roots in the mid-90s, as Silicon Valley began to situate itself in Santa Clara county.
    Cities including but not limited to Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Mountain View, and Cupertino have many of the millionaires
    (and even billionaires) of the world. According to Wikipedia, the San Francisco Bay Area is second in the world (just behind New
    York) for it's number of milionaires; and Silicon Valley's industry isn't nearly as old! The socioeconomic disparity is 
    unprecedented, and it's only poised to worsen.
  </p>

  <p>
    This visualization focuses on contemporary gentrification, from the year 2010 to the year 2023. We hope this will hammer home that this
    problem is not only a current issue, but one that isn't going away anytime soon. For abundant insight into Silicon Valley and how we
    intended to relate it's 2010's success to rising Bay Area gentrification, check out our report! Instructions to access it are available

  <h2>Measuring Gentrification</h2>

  <p>
    Measuring gentrification is complicated. <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscape/vol26num1/ch20.pdf">This article</a>
    operationalizes how to measure gentrification into 5 attributes, which have been acquired from the 2010-2023 American Community Survey (ACS).
    We have modified the formula and it's use-case, which will be touched on momentarily. The 5 attributes, and how to calculate gentrification 
    with them, is tabulated below:
  </p>

  <table class="gentrification-table">
    <caption>Gentrification Criteria to Quantify Tracts</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>ACS Variable</th>
        <th>Criteria for Gentrification</th>
        <th>Census Variable Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Median household income (1)</td>
        <td>
          If the tract's proportional increase for the given year is <em>above</em> the county's median proportional increase.
        </td>
        <td>S1901</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Median home value (2)</td>
        <td>If a tract’s proportional increase for the given year is <em>higher</em> than the countywide median proportional increase.</td>
        <td>S2506</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gross rent (3)</td>
        <td>If a tract’s proportional increase for the given year is <em>higher</em> than the countywide median proportional increase in rent cost.</td>
        <td>B25064</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Vacancy rate (4)</td>
        <td>If the tract's proportional decrease of vacant housing units is <em>above</em> the county's proportional median decrease of vacant housing units.</td>
        <td>B25002</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Educational attainment (5)</td>
        <td>Proportional increase in the population of people age 25 or over with a bachelor's degree or higher is <em>above</em> the countywide median 
            proportional increase in the population of people age 25 or over with a bachelor's degree or higher.
        </td>
        <td>S1501</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

    A few tweaks have been incorporated for measurement of this criteria:
  <ul>
    <li>Attribute rate of change is compared on a year-to-year basis for each attribute.</li>
    <li>The gentrification criteria in the article performs this logic on a citywide basis. We've elected to do countywide for simpler JSON representation.</li>
    <li>Gentrification is not <em>binary</em> in our visualization. For the heatmap, levels of gentrification is mapped to a color gradient based on a formula.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And thus we arrive at a formula for computing a "coefficient of gentrification" for a census tract in a given year, to allow the heatmap to really shine. 
    A tract's gentrification coefficient for the year is calculated with the following steps:
  </p>

  <ol>

    <li>
    \(\forall X_n \text{, where} ~ n = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\). See the table for \( n \) labels.
    </li>

    <li>
    \( X_n \) corresponds to attribute n for the census tract for the current year
    </li>

    <li>
    \(x_n\) corresponds to attribute n for the census tract for the previous year
    </li>

    <li>
      \( \tilde{X}_n\) is the county median for attribute n in the current year 
    </li>

    <li>
    \(\tilde{x}_n\) is the county median for attribute n in the previous year
    </li>

    <li>
    \( G_n = \frac{X_n}{x_n} \)
    </li>

    <li>
    \( \tilde{G}_n = \frac{\tilde{X}_n}{\tilde{x}_n} \)
    </li>

    <li>
    \( \text{if} ~ \frac{G_n}{\tilde{G}_n} > 1 ~ \text{, then n is a gentrifiable attribute for the census tract} \)
    </li>

    
    <li>
      Note this is slightly different for educational attainment, which is a decrease in percentage, 
      so this attribute \(n\) is a gentrifying attribute if \( \frac{G_n}{\tilde{G}_n} < 1 \)
    </li>

    <li>
      To make educational attainment compatible, a logarithm is used on fractional values to normalize
      the scale. To keep all values positive, the logarithm for educational attainment is flipped, since
      \( - \log (\frac{G_n}{\tilde{G}_n} ) \) = \( \log ( \frac{\tilde{G}_n}{G_n} ) \). Otherwise
      educaional attainment would be negative for the formula below.
    </li>

    <li>
      The measure of gentrification can thus be determined as the average <em> of the log </em> of 
      gentrifying attributes, \(M\), where 
      \( M = \frac{1}{5}\Sigma_{n = 1}^5~\log(\frac{G_n}{\tilde{G}_n}) \). 
      So the more attributes that are gentrifiable, the greater the gentrification measurement of the 
      tract, and educational attainment is accounted for (it has the additional benefit of 
      suppressing significant outliers).
    </li>

    <li>
      The final, simpler form of the equation becomes 
      \( M = \frac{1}{5}\Sigma_{n = 1}^5~\log(G_n) - \log(\tilde{G}_n) \).
      And the term for educational attainment is \( \log(\tilde{G}_n) - \log(G_n) \)
    </li>

    <li>
      If \( M \leq 0 \), then the census tract has not experienced any gentrification, with \( M = 0 \) signifying the threshold. If \( M > 0 \), then it is gentrifying.
    </li>

    <li>
      \( M \leq 0 \) maps to a white color, indicating no gentrification at all. \( M > 0 \) will 
      be a color-spectrum from white to red, with the color red being the highest value recorded for 
      \(M\); this is the most gentrifying census tract across all years, since the values are measured
      across the timeline. A gray census tract indicates the data is incomplete, which is determined 
      if one or more of the 5 gentrification attributes are undefined (or 0).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The year 2010 is our baseline, which means it will not have any measured gentrification.
    You are encouraged to start at this year for a county, and see how it changes over time into the year 2023.
    By quantifying gentrification with the heatmap, the hope is to indicate socioeconomic disparity 
    at a higher granularity. Note this gentrification measurement is absolute, for 2010-2023: all of the \(M\)
    scores for each year are measured at the onset of the visualization, and then the colorscale is applied for
    a given county. This enables the user to see where the change in gentrification is at it's worst, and answer a
    salient question: is gentrification getting worse year-after-year?
  </p>

  <p>
    A 6th attribute, population, is also measured across census tracts. While it does not correlate to gentrification, it
    does loosely correlate to residential displacement, which is a typical side-affect of a gentrifying neighborhood.
  </p>

  <h2>How To Navigate?</h2>

  <p>
    Click on counties to visit them, then scroll on the timeline bar to see how census tracts change overtime. 
    Click on a census tract to focus on how it has changed over the years; simply hover to view the attributes
    for the given year. And that is it! The finer details for interaction will be expressed in the visualization.

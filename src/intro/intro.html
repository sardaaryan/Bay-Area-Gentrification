    <h1>The Bay Area Gentrification Crisis</h1>
    <p>How the San Francisco Bay Area became the most expensive region in the United States</p>
  </div>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>

  <p>
    The San Francisco Bay Area is a vibrant region of our great country, and one of the most economically fertile
    metropolitan areas in the entire world. It is also the source of arguably the worst gentrification and housing
    shortage in the United States of America, outstripping even places such as Manhattan and Los Angeles, in
    housing costs and socioeconomic disparity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gentrification is complex, and while there is no scholarly consensus on it’s exact definition, it is generally
    understood as the process of wealthier individuals moving into lower-income neighborhoods, causing
    displacement of local residents, increased property value, costlier rents, and a shift in community culture.
    Indelibly, this leads to a housing shortage, as the cost of buying a home becomes too unaffordable for median
    income buyers. In the case of the Bay Area, this shortage is vast. The presence of these phenomena in the
    bay have a shared cause: Silicon Valley.

  <p>
    Technological innovation around the world, and the computer science industry at large, can be traced
    back to Silicon Valley in the Bay Area. Indeed, it is still the greatest tech hub in the world. Although this
    is a source of great pride, it is also the predominant cause of gentrification in the Bay Area, as highly paid
    engineers oust the local residents from the market. As such, as of 2025, it is the most expensive place to live
    in the United States.

            While not touched on in the visualization, gentrification leads to housing crisis, which exacerbates 
            the homelessness epidemic in California at-large. Large tent encampments, like the one pictured here, are
            a common sight throughout the Bay Area.

  <p>
    This is a significant problem that has its roots in the mid-90s, as Silicon Valley began to situate itself in San Jose.
    This visualization focuses on contemporary gentrification, from the year 2010 to the year 2023.

  <h2>Measuring Gentrification</h2>

  <p>
    Measuring gentrification is complicated. <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscape/vol26num1/ch20.pdf">This article</a>
    operationalizes how to measures gentrification into 5 attributes, which have been acquired from the 2010-2023 American Community Survey (ACS).
    The 5 attributes, and how to calculate gentrification with them, is tabulated below:
  </p>

  <table class="gentrification-table">
    <caption>Gentrification Criteria to Quantify Tracts</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>ACS Variable</th>
        <th>Criteria for Gentrification</th>
        <th>Census Variable Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Median household income</td>
        <td>
          If the tract's percentage increase is <em>above</em> the county's percentage increase.
        </td>
        <td>S1901</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Median home value</td>
        <td>If a tract’s percentage increase for home value is <em>higher</em> than the countywide median percentage increase in home value.</td>
        <td>S2506</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gross rent</td>
        <td>If a tract’s percentage is <em>higher</em> than the countywide percentage increase in rent cost.</td>
        <td>B25064</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Occupancy Rate</td>
        <td>If the percentage decrease is <em>above</em> the county's percentage decrease.</td>
        <td>B25002</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Educational attainment</td>
        <td>Percentage increase in college educated residents is <em>above</em> the countywide percentage increase in college educated residents.</td>
        <td>S1501</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

    A few tweaks have been incorporated for measurement of this criteria:
  <ul>
    <li>Percentage change is compared on a year-to-year basis for each attribute.</li>
    <li>The gentrification criteria in the article performs this logic on a citywide basis. We've elected to do countywide for simpler JSON representation.</li>
    <li>Gentrification is not <em>heterogeneous</em> in our visualization. For the heatmap, levels of gentrification is mapped to a color gradient based on a baseline.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And thus we arrive at a formula for computing a "coefficient of gentrification" for a given year, to allow the heatmap to really shine. A tract is considered gentrified for the year if:
  </p>

  <ol>

    <li>
    \(\forall X_n \text{, where} ~ n = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\)
    </li>

    <li>
    \( X_n \) corresponds to attribute n for the census tract for the given year
    </li>

    <li>
    \(x_n\) corresponds to attribute n for the census tract for the previous year
    </li>

    <li>
      \( \overline{X}_n\) is the county average for attribute n in the current year 
    </li>

    <li>
    \(\overline{x}_n\) is the county average for attribute n in the previous year
    </li>

    <li>
    \( G_n = \frac{X_n}{x_n} \)
    </li>

    <li>
    \( \overline{G}_n = \frac{\overline{X}_n}{\overline{x}_n} \)
    </li>

    <li>
    \( \text{if} ~ \frac{G_n}{\overline{G}_n} > 1 ~ \text{, then n is a gentrifiable attribute for the census tract} \)
    </li>

    <li>
    \( \text{The census tract is gentrifiable if and only if all n attributes are gentrifiable} \)
    </li>

    <li>
      The measure of gentrification can be determined as the average of gentrifying attributes, or \( M = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^n~\frac{G_i}{\overline{G}_i}}{5} \). This holds <em>only</em> if all attributes are gentrifying by the above steps.
    </li>

  </ol>

  <p>
    Note this is slightly different for educational attainment, which is a decrease in percentage, 
    so this attribute \(n\) is a gentrifying attribute if \( \frac{G_n}{\overline{G}_n} < 1 \)
  </p>

  <p>
    The year 2010 is our baseline, which means it will not have any measured gentrification.
    You are encouraged to start at this year for a county, and see how it changes over time into the year 2023.
    The value M thus measures the intensity of gentrification, which is mapped to the colorscale, but only if all 5
    attributes are gentrifiying. By removing the binary label of "gentrified" or "non-gentrified", the hope is to indicate
    socioeconomic disparity at a higher granularity.
  </p>

  <p>
    A 6th attribute, population, is also measured across census tracts. While it does not correlate to gentrification, it
    does loosely correlate to residential displacement, which is a typical side-affect of a gentrifying neighborhood.
  </p>

  <h2>How To Navigate?</h2>

  <p>
    Click on counties to visit them, then scroll on the timeline bar to see how census tracts change overtime. 
    Hover over a census tract to focus on how it has changed over the years, as well as viewing the attributes
    for the given year. And that is it! The details will be expressed in the visualization.

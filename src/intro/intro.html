  <h1>The Problem</h1>

  <p>
    The San Francisco Bay Area is a vibrant region of our great country, and one of the most economically fertile
    metropolitan areas in the entire world. It is also the source of arguably the worst gentrification and housing
    shortage in the United States of America, outstripping even places such as Manhattan and Los Angeles, in
    housing costs and socioeconomic disparity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gentrification is complex, and while there is no scholarly consensus on itâ€™s exact definition, it is generally
    understood as the process of wealthier individuals moving into lower-income neighborhoods, causing
    displacement of local residents, increased property value, costlier rents, and a shift in community culture.
    Indelibly, this leads to a housing shortage, as the cost of buying a home becomes too unaffordable for median
    income buyers. In the case of the Bay Area, this shortage is vast. The presence of these phenomena in the
    bay have a shared cause: Silicon Valley.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technological innovation around the world, and the computer science industry at large, can be traced
    back to Silicon Valley in the Bay Area. Indeed, it is still the greatest tech hub in the world. Although this
    is a source of great pride, it is also the predominant cause of gentrification in the Bay Area, as highly paid
    engineers oust the local residents from the market. As such, as of 2025, it is the most expensive place to live
    in the United States.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a significant problem that has its roots in the mid-90s, as Silicon Valley began to situate itself in San Jose.

  <h2>Measuring Gentrification</h2>

  <p>
    Measuring gentrification is complicated. <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscape/vol26num1/ch20.pdf">This article</a>
    operationalizes how to measures gentrification into 5 attributes, which have been acquired from the 2010-2023 American Community Survey.
    The 5 attributes, and how we calculate gentrification with them, are tabulated below:

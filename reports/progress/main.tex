\section{Method}

Although Team 17 has finishing touches to put on the design paradigm of our visualization, it is essentially complete. We will list out the primary components here, and have also included the diagram from our previous report for emphasis, since our design has not changed significantly since creating it. It is broken into 3 main components, with the third component housing most of the visualization, and being the most complicated. We'll start by discussing it's overall design, before getting into what has been implemented so far. Then, we'll touch on how it tells the story, as well as what has changed in the design since our proposal.

\subsection{Current Design}

\begin{description}

    \item[Introduction:] After feedback from Professor Liu, we have decided to begin with a martini glass-like introduction, while still retaining our fully exploratory \& interactive drill-down map configuration. The visualization begins with this introduction, highlighting the purpose of the visualization, and how to interact with it, before releasing the user to freely explore the Bay Area gentrification map.
    
    \item[Bay Area Map:] The user is then be greeted with the 9-county view of the bay area (see Figure~\ref{fig:first}), in which they will be able to select one of the 9 counties presented. This aspect of the visualization is pretty simplified, beyond making it clear that the counties can be toggled.
    
    \item[County Heatmap:] Here is where the visualization gets complicated; it is portrayed in Figure~\ref{fig:second}. We walk through it's various features below. This is what the user sees when a county is selected.
    
    \begin{description}
    
        \item[Census Tract Heatmap:] Perhaps the most advanced part of the entire project, the census tracts of a county are be represented as a heatmap. It's a conventional 2-color heatmap from white to red; white represents no gentrification in a given county tract, whereas red indicates complete gentrification. As a colorscale gradient, most census tracts are somewhere between these two colors. Grey census tracts indicate the gentrification criteria is not complete, and so it isn't categorized. By hovering over a census tract, the user can see the various attributes for a given census tract: it's Median Home Value, Median Household Income, Occupancy Status (also known as Vacancy Status), Gross Rent, Population, and Educational Attainment (thanks to the American Community Survey). This is the core of the county visualization, but it is not everything.  
        
        \item[2010-2023 Timeline:] Just as important as the gentrification criteria themselves is visualizing how they \textit{change} for given census tracts over the years. The user interacts with a slider that moves from 2010 to 2023, and the year of census tract values correspond to the year on the slider. The heatmap changes in "real-time", and the user is be able to see how particular communities change in their gentrification criteria (with the heatmap).
        
        \item[Vis Dashboard:] The dashboard "frames" the heatmap, and lies adjacent to it, as seen on the right-hand side of Figure~\ref{fig:second}. Using secondary visualizations to provide context for the heatmap, it consists of the following components:
        
        \begin{description}
        
            \item[Timeline Annotations:] One section of the dashboard consists of timeline annotations. This one is very important, as it provides context for what happened in the given year to corroborate shifts in gentrification. It is necessary context for the user to glean insights from the data, and contains a few salient bulletpoints. For interim/lull years, this will be indicated, if there are no significant events on the timeline. Figure~\ref{fig:second} shows "What Happened in Year?", but this formatting will likely change slightly in the final stages. So to summarize: these annotations will shift year-to-year to significant things that happened in the county. If they are particularly related to a specific part in the county map, there may be a point of interest system related to these annotations.
            
            \item[Stream Graph:] To compactly ascertain how the gentrification criteria changes over the years (since while the heatmap is quite interactive \& intuitive, it doesn't summarize \textit{how} the data changes effectively), a stream graph will show how the 6 attributes change from 2010-2023 for a selected census tract. If the user clicks on a census tract, then the stream graph (in the dashboard) will chart the change in gentrification criteria for this given census tract. This is abstractly represented in the middle of the dashboard in Figure~\ref{fig:second}.
            
            \item[Comparative Bar-Chart:] For the six attributes of the dataset, we have a small bar-chart that shows the average of the six attributes (across all census tracts for selected county) for the given year. This gives the user a quick snapshot of whether or not these values are increasing or decreasing year-to-year. Heatmaps are large, and a user cannot always immediately ascertain if gentrification has increased from one year to the next. This simple bar chart will clue the user in on heatmap trends, but it is not intended to be viewed in isolation.

\subsection{Implementation}

\begin{description}

    \item[Introduction:] The script for the martini-glass like introduction is written, but it still needs to be visualized in a separate D3 js visualization. It will consist of the script, images if they are needed, and a button to move to the bay area map.
    
    \item[Bay Area Map:] 
    
    \item[County Heatmap:] 
    
    \begin{description}
    
        \item[Census Tract Heatmap:] 
        
        \item[2010-2023 Timeline:] 
        
        \item[Vis Dashboard:] 
        
        \begin{description}
        
            \item[Timeline Annotations:] Research still needs to be finished for timeline annotations. The visualization aspect for these are at a reduced level; implementation will mostly consist of refining the text and adding where appropriate for each year.
            
            \item[Stream Graph:] The stream graph has not been visualized yet, but all of the data is prepared, so visualization should be pretty straightforward
            
            \item[Averages Bar Chart:] The bar chart has not been visualized, but it is pretty trivial, and the underlying dataset is prepared.
            
        \end{description}
        
    \end{description}
    
\end{description}

\subsection{Storytelling Aspects}

The storytelling of the project is buttressed by three key pieces: the introduction, the timeline annotations, and the composite data.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item The introduction will clue the user in on how to navigate our visualization, and importantly for the storytelling aspect, the kind of insights and shifts in data to look out for!
    
    \item The timeline annotations will support the gentrification criteria as it changes year-to-year. It will be very important in telling the story on a more granular scale; these annotations will also expand the scope whenever possible, to tie it to our main story of gentrification in the SF Bay Area.
    
    \item In terms of the data itself, it will be important that we get the "composite picture" of the data just right. When the user looks at the heatmap, combined with the visualization dashboard, and the interactive tools we offer, it will be crucial that all of it synthesizes into a singular, complete story. Each aspect of the data being visualized should support the other. We hope the heatmap-dashboard approach, combined with the timeline, will achieve this.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Changes}

Since our proposal report, the 2 most significant changes are the introduction visualization and the county dashboard. The introduction will help solidify the purpose and intent of our visualization, and we have laid out what the county dashboard will analyze; namely the stream graph and the bar chart (as discussed earlier in the report).

\section{Evaluation Plan}

Team 17 intends to have a testing \& review session during the last couple of days before finalizing submission. It will use the following approaches:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Comprehensive walkthrough of the visualization. Each of the five team-members will walk through all aspects of the visualization in one sitting, noting inconsistencies or things that differ from the project's vision. This will be done independently for maximum coverage. Then, if we have time, we will address these inconsistencies. 

    \item Compare visualization against proposal report \& teammember slideshow. Have we covered everything that we wanted to visualize? What are we missing? How? Have we fallen short in some aspects of the visualization? See how much fidelity our visualization has with respect to the original source material. We will pay attention to the questions and theses asked, and if the present visualization captures them (and if that matters).

    \item Heed feedback received from T/A's and Professors as we continue to finalize project development; either from the reports, the slideshow, or during office hours.
    
\end{itemize}



\section{Preliminary Results}

We do not have conclusive reports/insights so far. The heatmap is not finished, and the timeline annotation research has not been fully conducted. Once we have completed both of these in the next week, all of our insights will be delineated in our final report. Note this is also why there is not an \textit{abundance} of references in this report; we have amassed a large amount of sources and articles that cover bay area gentrification \& housing, but we need to narrow it down to only especially pertinent articles for timeline annotations (as well as the introduction). All sources for these annotations will be cited in the final report. 

\section{Plan of Activities}

The following Gantt chart illustrates the timeline of key project tasks, when they are occurring, who is primarily responsible for them, and their progress. Note that since this is a team project, everyone will likely contribute to every aspect of the project in some way. The singular names indicate who has been assigned to oversee an aspect of the project.

\input{gantt}

Note this plan of activities is dynamic, and will potentially change as the needs of our project change going into the final 10 days of development.

\section{Team's Effort Division}

Team 17 feels that every member of the team has contributed satisfactorily to our Bay Area Gentrification project, serving in different roles and capacities as the need arose. We have no concerns with the output of each team member!

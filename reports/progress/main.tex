\section{Team's Effort Division}

\begin{itemize}
\item Please provide a brief effort distribution statement at the end. It can be as simple as "all team members have contributed a similar amount of effort". If effort distribution is too uneven, we might consider assigning higher scores to members who have contributed more.
